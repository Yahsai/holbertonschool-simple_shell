.SH NAME
Simple Shell - command language Interpreter

.SH SYPNOSIS
#include "main.h"
./hsh

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Simple Shell is a straightforward command language interpreter designed
to process commands from standard input. It currently offers basic shell
functionality, supporting the following features:

- Execution of commands with arguments
- Handling of environmental variables
- Shell termination

However, it currently lacks support for more advanced features such as:

- Piping
- Redirections
- Pattern matching
- Variable expansions

The Simple Shell is intended for users seeking a minimalistic shell experience
and does not include these advanced functionalities. Future updates may
consider incorporating additional features.

.SS INVOCATION

.IP Non-Interactive

.SS SHELL BUILTIN COMMANDS
